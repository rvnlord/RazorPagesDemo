## Example Razor Pages Employees Management System

The purpose of this project is to present my knowledge of Razor Pages to anybody who seeks to verify my knowledge. This is one of the solutions I created during the process of learning the technology and will be replaced with a meaningful project as soon as I have something else to share that can be made available for general public.
